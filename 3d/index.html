  <p>I know what you're thinking: 3D design like Blender or Maya? No. I do parametric stuff like Solidworks and Creo. Although I can make
    some pretty nice complex surfaces so don't think I can't make what you're thinking about.

    I've got a $48 dollar a year maker subscription to solidworks and I wanna make it worthwhile. Making little brackets to hold
    succulents around my house doesn't quite meet that threshold.

Sorry you have to read this block of text, I mostly made this website for photography stuff and didn't really put much effort into the 
other things.</p>
